# atari-breakout
Recreation of the classic Atari Breakout game using an FPGA + Microblaze soft processor. Built to work on any VGA display.

This project was created as my final for my Hardware/Software Co-Design class at SLU. Apologies for the chaotic file organization, it was a bit rushed :D

Made using Xilinx Vivado with a Basys 3 FPGA.
